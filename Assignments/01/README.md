# Instructions

Write a C++ program to print the following console output:

```plaintext
+----------------------+
| Hello from CISC 3142 |
+----------------------+
```

*Additional Notes: Regarding your code's standard output, CodeLab will check for case errors and will check whitespace (tabs, spaces, newlines) exactly except that it will ignore all trailing whitespace.*
