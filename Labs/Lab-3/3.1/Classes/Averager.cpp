/*
    Write the implementation (.cpp file) of the Averager class of the previous exercise. The full specification of the class is:

        - A data member named sum of type integer.
        - A data member named count of type integer.
        - A constructor with no parameters. The constructor initializes the data members sum and the data member count to 0.
        - A function named getSum that accepts no parameters and returns an integer. getSum returns the value of sum.
        - A function named add that accepts an integer parameter and returns no value. add increases the value of sum by the value of the
        parameter, and increments the value of count by one.
        - A function named getCount that accepts no parameters and returns an integer. getCount returns the value of the count data member, that is, the
        number of values added to sum.
        - A function named getAverage that accepts no parameters and returns a double. getAverage returns the average of the values added to sum.
        The value returned should be a value type of double (and therefore you must cast the data members to double prior to performing the division).
